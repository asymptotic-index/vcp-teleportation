# Energy and Resources
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document examines the **energy and resource implications** of Teleportation,
even though teleportation itself is assumed to be free.

The goal is to show that removing cost from transport does not remove the
**magnitude** of what must be removed.

---

## Energy Removal Requirements

Lower-bound thermal energy stored in Venus’s atmosphere:

E_atm ≈ 1.6 × 10²⁶ J

This energy must be removed:
- Faster than incoming solar energy
- Over extended periods
- Without interruption

Teleportation changes *how* energy leaves, not *how much* must leave.

---

## Continuous Energy Balance

Venus absorbs solar power at approximately:

P_solar ≈ 1.6 × 10¹⁷ W

To cool Venus:
- Teleportation must remove **more than this power continuously**
- Otherwise, equilibrium temperature remains unchanged

This requirement never ends.

---

## Mass Removal Energy Implications

If teleporting atmospheric mass:

- Removing gas also removes its associated thermal energy
- But remaining atmosphere continues trapping heat
- Large fractions must be removed to matter

Teleporting small amounts yields negligible returns.

---

## Resource Implications (Despite “Free” Transport)

Even with free teleportation, implied resources include:

- Infinite operational uptime
- Control over planetary-scale volumes
- Continuous targeting and coordination

These are conceptual, not engineering, resources.

---

## Comparison to Non-Fantasy Concepts

Teleportation removes:
- Propulsion energy
- Infrastructure limits
- Transport inefficiencies

Yet the remaining requirements are comparable in magnitude to:
- Laser Cooling
- Space Radiators
- Other theoretical approaches

This reinforces the dominance of scale.

---

## Key Insight

> Making transport free does not make removal small.

Teleportation reveals that **quantity**, not **cost**, defines difficulty.

---

## Summary

- Required energy removal is enormous
- Teleportation must operate continuously
- Planetary cooling remains a scale problem

Teleportation simplifies the *mechanism* but not the *task*.
