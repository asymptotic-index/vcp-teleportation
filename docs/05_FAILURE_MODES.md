# Failure Modes
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document enumerates the **primary failure modes** of the Teleportation
concept. These failures occur **even when teleportation works perfectly**.

They demonstrate that breaking physics does not eliminate planetary-scale
constraints.

## Failure Mode 1 — Mass Dominance

**Description:**  
Insufficient atmospheric mass is removed to affect climate.

**Cause:**  
- Enormous total atmospheric mass
- Greenhouse trapping requires large-scale removal

**Effect:**  
- Negligible pressure and temperature change

**Classification:**  
Scale failure

---

## Failure Mode 2 — Heat Replenishment

**Description:**  
Removed heat is rapidly replaced.

**Cause:**  
- Continuous solar input
- Greenhouse re-radiation

**Effect:**  
- Cooling stalls without uninterrupted teleportation

**Classification:**  
Energy balance failure

---

## Failure Mode 3 — Throughput Limitation

**Description:**  
Teleportation rate is too low.

**Cause:**  
- Unrealistic assumptions about continuous mass/energy removal rates

**Effect:**  
- Cooling requires impractically long timescales

**Classification:**  
Rate failure

---

## Failure Mode 4 — Partial Removal Fallacy

**Description:**  
Removing “some” atmosphere is assumed sufficient.

**Cause:**  
- Nonlinear greenhouse response
- Threshold effects in pressure and opacity

**Effect:**  
- Large effort yields little benefit

**Classification:**  
Modeling error

---

## Failure Mode 5 — Indefinite Operation Requirement

**Description:**  
Teleportation must run forever to maintain cooling.

**Cause:**  
- Persistent solar heating
- No passive stabilization mechanism

**Effect:**  
- Cooling is not a terminal state

**Classification:**  
Maintenance failure

---

## Failure Mode 6 — Scale Blindness

**Description:**  
Teleportation’s magical nature obscures magnitude.

**Cause:**  
- Focus on *how* instead of *how much*

**Effect:**  
- Underestimation by orders of magnitude

**Classification:**  
Conceptual failure

## Summary

> Teleportation fails quietly,  
> not because it is weak, but because Venus is large.

Even magic cannot cheat scale.
