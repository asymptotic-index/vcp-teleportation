Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

## Versioning Scheme

This project uses a simplified semantic versioning model:

- **MAJOR** — Conceptual scope change or reframing of the fantasy premise
- **MINOR** — New analytical coverage or comparative extensions
- **PATCH** — Clarifications, corrections, formatting, or math cleanup

---

## Change Log

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release
- Established explicit fantasy classification and ethical framing
- Defined teleportation as a deliberate physics violation
- Analyzed atmospheric mass and heat removal under idealized assumptions
- Demonstrated persistence of scale and energy constraints
- Identified failure modes that remain even with “magic”
- Added scale comparisons and human-scale analogies
- Included glossary, appendix, and scientific references for real physics

---

## Notes

This repository uses fantasy as an analytical tool.  
Future updates may refine framing, assumptions, or comparisons without altering
the core conclusion that planetary-scale problems are dominated by totals, not
transport mechanisms.
