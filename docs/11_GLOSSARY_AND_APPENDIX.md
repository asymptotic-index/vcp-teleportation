# Glossary and Appendix
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose

This document provides a **reference guide** for terminology, symbols, constants,
and shorthand used throughout the Teleportation repository.

Because this project includes an explicit fantasy element, this appendix helps
clearly distinguish fictional assumptions from real physical accounting.

No new arguments are introduced here.

## Glossary — Core Concepts

### Teleportation (Project Definition)
A fictional capability allowing instantaneous, lossless relocation of matter or
energy to an arbitrary destination without traversal of intervening space or
cost.

This definition explicitly violates known physics.

---

### Scale Dominance
A condition in which total quantities (mass, energy, time) dominate outcomes
regardless of method or efficiency.

---

### Energy Balance
The accounting of energy entering, leaving, and stored within a system. Even
under fantasy assumptions, balance must still be satisfied.

---

### Greenhouse Trapping
The absorption and re-emission of infrared radiation by atmospheric gases,
reducing net energy loss and increasing surface temperature.

---

### Thermal Inertia
The resistance of a system to temperature change due to stored heat energy.

---

### Continuous Operation
Sustained, uninterrupted activity over long periods. Required for any lasting
effect in planetary cooling.

## Notes on Interpretation

- Teleportation is fictional; all other quantities are real
- Values are order-of-magnitude unless stated otherwise
- SI units are used throughout
- Fantasy is used to expose scale, not hide it

## Closing Note

> When even magic struggles,  
> the problem is not the tools.

This appendix exists to keep the fantasy honest.
