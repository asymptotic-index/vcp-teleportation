# Environment
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document describes the **environmental context** in which Teleportation is
applied and explains why environmental factors still matter even when transport
is instantaneous and free.

---

## Venus Environmental Context

Venus is characterized by:
- Dense CO₂ atmosphere (~92 bar)
- Extremely high surface temperatures (~737 K)
- Strong greenhouse trapping
- Slow radiative heat loss

Teleportation does not alter these conditions unless it removes large quantities
of mass or energy continuously.

---

## Atmospheric Dynamics

Venus’s atmosphere is:
- Highly mixed
- Rapidly redistributing heat horizontally
- Slowly responding vertically

Consequences:
- Localized teleportation produces negligible global change
- Removed material is quickly replaced by surrounding gas

Teleportation must act globally to matter.

---

## Solar Environment

Venus receives intense solar radiation.

Teleportation must:
- Remove heat faster than it is added by the Sun
- Continue indefinitely to maintain any temperature reduction

Environmental input never stops.

---

## Planetary Thermal Inertia

The atmosphere and surface store enormous heat energy.

Results:
- Short-duration teleportation has minimal effect
- Cooling requires long-term sustained removal
- Environmental memory dominates response

---

## Interaction With Space

Teleportation bypasses space as an environment:
- No transport losses
- No radiation path required

However, this does not change:
- How much heat must leave
- How fast it must leave

---

## Environmental Feedbacks

Teleportation does not inherently change:
- Atmospheric composition
- Cloud formation
- Greenhouse opacity

Unless mass is removed, feedbacks remain unchanged.

---

## Summary

> Teleportation bypasses the environment,  
> but it does not bypass environmental balance.

Venus’s environment continues to dictate outcomes.
