# Assumptions
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document lists the **explicit assumptions** used throughout the Teleportation
analysis. These assumptions are intentionally extreme in order to isolate the
effects of scale.

Teleportation itself is assumed to work perfectly.

---

## Teleportation Assumptions

Teleportation is assumed to be:

- Instantaneous
- Lossless
- Perfectly targeted
- Unlimited in range
- Free of energy cost
- Free of side effects

No momentum recoil, waste heat, or causality issues are considered.

This is an explicit violation of known physics.

## Planetary Assumptions

Baseline properties of Venus:

- Atmospheric mass: ~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg  
- Mean surface temperature: ~737 K  
- Surface pressure: ~92 bar  
- Solar flux at Venus: ~2,613 W/m²  

These values are treated as constant unless directly altered by teleportation.

---

## Atmospheric Assumptions

- Atmospheric composition remains CO₂-dominated unless mass is removed
- Remaining atmosphere behaves normally
- No spontaneous collapse occurs without mass removal

Teleportation does not alter chemistry unless mass is removed.

---

## Energy Accounting Assumptions

Despite teleportation:
- Energy removed is counted honestly
- Incoming solar energy continues
- Greenhouse trapping continues unless mass is removed

Teleportation does not “turn off” thermodynamics.

---

## Temporal Assumptions

- Teleportation operates continuously
- Cooling is evaluated over long timescales
- Short-term effects are considered negligible

---

## Human and Social Assumptions

- No economic limits
- No political limits
- No governance constraints

Only physical accounting remains.

---

## Summary

> These assumptions remove *everything* except scale.

If teleportation fails here, it fails everywhere.
