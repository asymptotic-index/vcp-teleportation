# Scale Comparisons
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document provides **scale comparisons** to illustrate how large the
Teleportation task remains even when all transport constraints are removed.

These comparisons emphasize that teleportation changes *mechanism*, not *scale*.

## Atmospheric Mass Removal Scale

Total atmospheric mass of Venus:

M ≈ 4.8 × 10²⁰ kg

### Perspective

- Removing **1 billion kg per second** (already absurdly large):
  - Annual removal ≈ 3.2 × 10¹⁶ kg
  - Time to remove entire atmosphere ≈ **15,000 years**

Teleportation must operate at extreme rates for millennia.

---

## Heat Removal Scale

Lower-bound atmospheric thermal energy:

E_atm ≈ 1.6 × 10²⁶ J

---

## Comparison to Human Energy Use

Current global human energy consumption:

≈ 6 × 10²⁰ J/year

### Equivalent

- Atmospheric heat ≈ **270,000 years** of current human energy use

Teleportation removes transport cost, not energy magnitude.

---

## Continuous Power Equivalent

Incoming solar power to Venus:

P_solar ≈ 1.6 × 10¹⁷ W

Teleportation must remove **more than this power continuously** to cool the planet.

That is equivalent to:
- ~160,000 one-terawatt systems running nonstop

---

## Human Running Equivalent (Absurd but Grounded)

Assume:
- 75 kg person
- ~75 kcal per km
- 1 kcal ≈ 4,184 J

Energy per kilometer:

E_run ≈ 3.1 × 10⁵ J/km

### Conversion

- Teleporting Venus’s atmospheric heat ≈ **5 × 10²⁰ km of running**

That distance is roughly:
- **50 billion light-years**
- ≈ **4×** the diameter of the observable universe

## Time Scale Illustration

Even with magical throughput:
- Cooling is measured in centuries to millennia
- Instant effects are illusory
- Progress is linear against vast totals

---

## Why These Comparisons Matter

Teleportation tempts intuition into thinking “instant = solved.”
These comparisons exist to break that illusion.

---

## Summary

> Even magic obeys arithmetic.

Teleportation shows that planetary problems are dominated by totals, not tricks.
