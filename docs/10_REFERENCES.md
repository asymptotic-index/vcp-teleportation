# References
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose

This document lists **scientific, educational, and conceptual references** used
to ground the Teleportation project once the fictional premise is granted.

Teleportation itself has no scientific references by design. All sources below
support the *real physics* that resumes immediately after the fantasy allowance.

real constraints, not as a substitute for science.

## Notes on Usage

- Teleportation itself has no citations because it is fictional.
- All quantitative conclusions derive from referenced physical principles.
- References constrain scale intuition rather than justify the fantasy premise.
