# Scope and Ethics
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **scope**, **intent**, and **ethical framing** of the
Teleportation project. Because this project is explicitly fantastical, clarity of
intent is especially important.

---

## Project Scope

Teleportation examines the following deliberately fictional premise:

> Matter or energy can be instantaneously relocated from Venus to elsewhere,
> without cost, loss, delay, or physical mechanism.

Within that premise, the project asks:
- How much mass or energy must be removed to cool Venus?
- How fast would teleportation need to occur?
- What planetary effects remain even when transport is “free”?

All analysis beyond the teleportation assumption adheres to quantitative
accounting.

## Out of Scope

This project explicitly does **not**:
- Attempt to explain or justify teleportation
- Propose real technologies or experiments
- Argue that teleportation is plausible
- Blend fantasy with real physics without labeling it

Teleportation is treated as a *given*, not a theory.

---

## Ethical Framing

Although fantastical, this project still engages with real ethical concerns.

Key positions:

- **Honest labeling:**  
  The project is clearly marked as Fantasy to avoid confusion.

- **Non-advocacy:**  
  The project does not suggest Venus should be modified.

- **Educational intent:**  
  Fantasy is used to reveal truths about scale, not to mislead.

- **Respect for science:**  
  Real physics resumes immediately once teleportation is assumed.

## Responsible Use of Fantasy

Fantasy is often used to hide difficulty. Here, it is used to **expose it**.

Teleportation is not a shortcut to success; it is a stress test for intuition.

## Summary

> This project asks not “can we cheat physics,”  
> but “does cheating even help?”

Ethical clarity ensures the answer is instructive rather than misleading.
