# Restrictions and Limitations
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document identifies the **remaining restrictions and limitations** that
apply even when teleportation is assumed to function perfectly.

Teleportation removes transport constraints. It does **not** remove planetary
scale, energy balance, or time.

---

## Scale of Atmospheric Mass

Teleportation does not change the fact that Venus’s atmosphere contains:

M ≈ 4.8 × 10²⁰ kg

To meaningfully reduce greenhouse trapping:
- A large fraction of this mass must be removed
- Partial or localized removal is insufficient

The limitation is **quantity**, not method.

---

## Continuous Solar Energy Input

Venus continuously absorbs solar energy.

Teleportation must remove heat:
- Faster than it is added by the Sun
- For as long as cooling is desired

Stopping teleportation immediately halts progress.

---

## Greenhouse Persistence

Unless atmospheric mass is removed:
- CO₂ continues to trap infrared radiation
- Re-radiation continues to recycle heat

Teleporting heat without removing gas requires **ongoing, indefinite operation**.

---

## Thermal Inertia

Venus’s atmosphere and surface store vast amounts of heat.

Consequences:
- Cooling is slow even with instant removal
- Short-term teleportation produces negligible change
- Long-duration operation is unavoidable

---

## Planetary Equilibration

As mass or heat is removed:
- The system re-equilibrates
- Pressure and temperature gradients adjust
- Remaining atmosphere expands and redistributes

Teleportation cannot “outrun” equilibration.

---

## Upper Bounds on Effectiveness

Even with perfect teleportation:
- Cooling rates are bounded by total removal rate
- Required rates remain planetary in scale

Teleportation lowers difficulty, but not magnitude.

---

## Summary

> Teleportation removes *distance*,  
> not *difficulty*.

The remaining limitations are imposed by scale and energy balance, not by
transport.
