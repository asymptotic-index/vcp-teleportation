# Planetary Impacts
Teleportation — Venus Cooling Project

## Purpose of This Document

This document evaluates the **planetary-scale impacts** of applying Teleportation
to Venus over extended periods, assuming perfect and continuous operation.

The focus is on global outcomes rather than local or transient effects.

## Impact on Atmospheric Pressure

If atmospheric mass is teleported away:

- Surface pressure decreases only in proportion to total mass removed
- Small removals produce negligible pressure change
- Meaningful pressure reduction requires removing a large fraction of the
  atmosphere

Teleportation does not change this proportionality.

---

## Impact on Surface Temperature

Cooling depends on:
- Reduced greenhouse trapping (mass removal), or
- Continuous heat removal exceeding solar input

Without sustained teleportation:
- Temperatures rebound
- Radiative equilibrium reasserts itself

Teleportation creates no passive cooling state.

---

## Impact on Atmospheric Structure

As mass is removed:
- Remaining atmosphere expands
- Scale height increases
- Pressure gradients re-equilibrate

These effects dilute the apparent impact of partial removal.

---

## Impact on Long-Term Climate Stability

Teleportation does not establish a new stable climate regime.

Instead:
- Cooling persists only while teleportation operates
- Stopping teleportation halts progress immediately
- Long-term stability is not achieved without ongoing intervention

---

## Impact on Planetary Evolution

Over geological timescales:
- Teleportation-driven changes are reversible
- Natural processes dominate once teleportation stops
- No permanent transformation is guaranteed

Teleportation does not alter Venus’s fundamental evolution trajectory.

---

## Comparative Perspective

Compared to other Venus Cooling Project concepts:
- Teleportation removes engineering constraints entirely
- Yet outcomes remain constrained by scale and energy balance

This reinforces the core lesson of the project.

## Summary

> Teleportation can change *rates*,  
> but not *requirements*.

Planetary impacts remain governed by mass, energy, and time.
