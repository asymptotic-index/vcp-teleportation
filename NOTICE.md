# NOTICE

This repository is part of the **Venus Cooling Project**, a collection of
independent studies exploring real, theoretical, speculative, and intentionally
fantastical ideas related to planetary cooling and engineering.

The **Teleportation** project is explicitly classified as **Fantasy**.

It intentionally violates known physical laws, including but not limited to:
- Conservation of energy
- Conservation of momentum
- Locality and causality
- Information transfer limits

These violations are not accidental. They are used deliberately to isolate and
examine the effects of **scale** when all realistic engineering constraints are
removed.

Teleportation is treated here as a fictional capability: the instantaneous,
cost-free relocation of matter or energy to an arbitrary destination. No attempt
is made to justify or derive such a mechanism within known physics.

Despite this allowance, the analysis remains quantitative and disciplined. Mass,
energy, and timescale accounting are still enforced to demonstrate that even
physics-breaking tools struggle when applied to planetary-scale problems.

No claim is made regarding feasibility, desirability, or originality. This work
is not a proposal for technology, experimentation, or action.

Authorship applies to the **structure, framing, analysis, and presentation** of
this project as an educational and comparative study.

This repository exists to make one point explicit:

> If a problem remains hard even with magic,  
> the problem is fundamentally about scale.

If you reference or build upon this material, attribution to the project or
